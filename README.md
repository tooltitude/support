# Tooltitude for Go

[Tooltitude for Go](https://www.tooltitude.com) is a productivity extension for the Go (GoLang) programming language.

## Features

### CodeLens Providers in Project Modules
Gain insights into your Go codebase, and understand usage patterns of functions, methods, fields, and interfaces.
We have CodeLens providers which help you navigate code and see what's going on in the codebase.

### References View
Our references view is tailored for Go. It allows you to see not only the file where the reference is located, but its package, and containing element (e.g. a function). Note: it works only with Tooltitude for Go CodeLens providers.

### Full LSP mode
Tooltitude for Go could act not only as a productivity extension, but as a Go language server. It could be used in a resource constrained environment where running both gopls and Tooltitude for Go isn't feasible.

This mode is activated only if the official Go extension is disabled. It's possible to disable it either globally or on a per-workspace basis. Then, reload the editor to activate the mode.
